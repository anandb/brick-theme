# Brick Theme

Brick is a light, warm theme with an earthy aesthetic. It uses a palette of tans, browns, and soft beiges designed to be easy on the eyes.

Unlike high-contrast white themes that can cause glare, Brick's lower contrast and natural tones provide a comfortable coding environment suitable for long sessions.
